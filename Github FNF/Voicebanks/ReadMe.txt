*Warning*

These are meant to be used for singing synthesizer (like UTAU or OpenUtau) They wont work as chromatics (especially long notes).

Also I know they are created weirdly (with the -- thing) I will might update to be more normal.

Also some lyrics are broken (especially long notes).

Any voicebanks can always be later changed in future update.
